### What is diffraction grating?

[Diffraction grating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffraction_grating) is a quantum effect,
commonly observed on CD-ROMs:

Diffraction grating happens when there is a surface of low entropy organized after some periodic wavelength of photons.
It happens around us all the time, but since most surfaces have high entropy and non-periodic structure,
one usually refers to this effect by the visible phenomena or when it is measurable in a controlled experiment.

### Why use diffraction grating to mitigate the climate crisis?

The climate crisis will likely result in a 6th mass extinction event unless we act.

Every fraction of a degree above +1.5C in global temperature matters and might be the difference between life and death.

If there is a cheap and efficient method to increase diffraction grating on the surface of large deserts,
such as Sahara, in frequencies that do not get easily trapped by greenhouse gases, then this might be important to research.

### Protection of wildlife

Deserts contain wildlife, which is more visible in raining seasons.
Any design or experiment must take wildlife into account.

### Reducing energy imbalance of the atmosphere

No single solution is likely to be successful for solving the climate crisis.

However, since every fraction of warming above +1.5C matters,
if one can e.g. reduce the global temperature with 0.1C without harming nature, then this would be a major achievement.

### Expert groups

The idea of this project is to organize expert groups focusing on various tasks:

- Data gathering
- Modeling and simulation
- Communication systems (e.g. satelite observations)
- Prototyping
- Engineering and optimization
- Experiment designs
- Theoretical development
- Predictions and evaluations
- Ethics and guidelines
- International cooperation
- Management
